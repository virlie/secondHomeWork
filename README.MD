By Virlie Joy Paglinawan
**Description**
A webpage (using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery) that asks users to input a number that is then counted up to starting at 1 and that count is converted into a list, translating certain values to ping, pong, or pingpong. If the number is divisible by 3, it becomes "ping". If it is divisible by 5, it becomes "pong". If divisible by both 3 and 5, it becomes "pingpong".
